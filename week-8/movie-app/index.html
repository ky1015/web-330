      Instructions:
      Create a webpage that displays information about movies from an in-memory array using
      JavaScript async/await, HTML, and CSS.
        1. HTML: Build a form for the user to enter a movie title, and sections to display the
        movieâ€™s title, director, release year, and a brief synopsis.
        2. CSS: Style your webpage to your liking. Make sure the movie information is clearly
        visible and the layout is user-friendly.
        3. JavaScript:
          a. Define an array of movie objects. Each object should have properties for the
          title, director, release year, and synopsis.
          b. Define a function named fetchMovie(title). This function should return a
          Promise that simulates fetching data for the given title from the array. Use
          setTimeout to simulate the delay of a network request. The resolved value
          should be the movie object that matches the title.
          c. Define an async function named displayMovie. This function should be
          called when the user submits the form. It should use await to wait for
          fetchMovie to complete, then update the HTML of the page to display the
          movie information.
        4. Error Handling: Your fetchMovie function should reject with an error message if the
        movie title is not found in the array. Your displayMovie function should handle these
        errors and display an appropriate message on the webpage.
